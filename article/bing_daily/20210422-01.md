## Celebrating Take Your Dog to Work Day (庆祝带你的狗去上班)

If every dog has its day, today may just be yours. Even if you can’t bring your dog to the office today, it’s the perfect time to paws and reflect on the benefits dogs bring to our lives. Proponents of Take Your Dog to Work Day, now in its 20th year, say canine companions reduce stress in the workplace and make for cheerful employees. Sounds like a win-win—now can you fetch me a coffee and a beagle? (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.)

如果每只狗都有自己的日子，那么今天可能就是你的了。即使您今天无法将狗带到办公室，也是时候用爪子思考一下狗带给我们生活的好处的最佳时机。支持犬工作日的支持者现在已经20岁了，他们说，犬友们可以减轻工作场所的压力，并为开朗的员工带来好处。听起来是双赢的，现在您能给我拿杯咖啡和小猎犬吗？ （对不起，我们无法抗拒。）

## Constitution Day and Citizenship Day (宪法日和公民日)

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day is a single celebration that commemorates the formation and signing of the US Constitution while also recognizing both naturalized citizens and those born in the US. It's a day to learn about these subjects, as well as a day many people become naturalized citizens in group ceremonies. (On average, about 700,000 people become US citizens every year.) To celebrate, we're looking at an unusual close-up of the Statue of Liberty, a welcoming sight to immigrants and a symbol of freedom since 1886. The statue's tablet has the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) inscribed in Roman numerals: JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.

宪法日和公民日是一次纪念活动，旨在纪念美国宪法的形成和签署，同时也承认入籍公民和在美国出生的公民。今天是学习这些主题的一天，也是许多人在团体仪式中成为入籍公民的一天。 （平均每年约有70万人成为美国公民。）为庆祝这一事件，我们正在看一个不寻常的自由女神像特写镜头，这是自1886年以来对移民的热烈欢迎和自由的象征。签署以罗马数字书写的《独立宣言》的日期（1776年7月4日）：MDCCLXXVI七月四日。


So why is today both Constitution Day and Citizenship Day? The reason is rooted in the World War II era. In 1940, Congress created I Am an American Day, a demonstration of US patriotism. Twelve years later, President Harry Truman signed into law Citizenship Day, which replaced I Am an American Day and moved the observance to September 17, the day the Constitution was signed in 1787. Eventually, in 2004 the day was designated as the mash-up of observances we have today—the jointly celebrated Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.

那么，为什么今天既是宪法日又是公民日？原因在于第二次世界大战时期。 1940年，国会创建了“我是美国人日”，以示美国爱国主义的表现。十二年后，哈里·杜鲁门（Harry Truman）总统签署了《公民身份日》，该日取代了“我是美国人日”，并将纪念日移至1787年宪法签署日的9月17日。最终，在2004年，纪念日被定为混搭今天的庆祝活动-共同庆祝的宪法日和公民日。
