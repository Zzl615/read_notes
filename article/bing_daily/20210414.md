In present-day Thailand sit the ruins of the ancient kingdom that preceded it, Ayutthaya. Wat Phra Si Sanphet, shown here, was the holiest site in the capital of that kingdom, a royal temple containing a 52-foot tall, golden Buddha among other treasures. The first king of Ayutthaya, Ramathibodi I, ordered construction of a royal palace here in 1350. Nearly a century later, they palace was moved to a different location in the city and the former palace grounds were converted to a holy site.

在当今的泰国，坐落于其前的古代王国大城府遗址。此处显示的玉佛寺（Wat Phra Si Sanphet）是该国首都最神圣的地方，是一座皇家庙宇，内含52英尺高的金色佛像和其他珍品。大城府的第一位国王拉玛蒂博迪一世（Ramathibodi I）在1350年下令在此建造王宫。近一个世纪后，他们将宫殿移至城市中的其他地点，并将以前的宫殿场地改建为圣地。


The three structures shown are called chedis, bell-like structures, topped with miniature chedis on their roofs. After serving as the seat of the kingdom for 417 years, the capital city of Ayutthaya was sacked in 1767 by the invading Burmese, who melted down the copious gold of the temples and palaces, then set the buildings on fire. All but these three chedis were completely destroyed, and over time they fell into ruin. Restoration began on the chedis in 1956, but only the foundations of the rest of the complex remain.

所示的三个结构被称为chedis，钟形结构，顶部带有微型chedis。首都大城府（Ayutthaya）曾在该国居住了417年，但在1767年被入侵的缅甸人洗劫一空，他们熔化了寺庙和宫殿的大量金币，然后纵火烧毁了这些建筑物。除了这三个佛塔之外，其他所有城堡都被彻底摧毁，随着时间的流逝，他们陷入了废墟。恢复始于1956年的chedis，但仅保留了该建筑群其余部分的基础。
