## A timeless view of the night sky (永恒的夜空景色)

The bright sweep of the Milky Way is especially vivid amid the mesas, canyons, and prehistoric towers of Hovenweep National Monument. Straddling the southern Colorado-Utah border, Hovenweep is so remote that almost no artificial light disturbs the view of star-filled skies. The dazzling nightscapes are little different from those seen by the Ancestral Puebloans who built these towers. They were a farming culture who first settled in the area roughly 1,100 years ago. By the late 1200s they numbered around 2,500 people and had built these and other structures in six different villages.Archaeologists offer several theories to explain the use of the buildings. Some may have been defensive fortifications, storage areas, homes, or any combination of these. But researchers suggest that the tower called Hovenweep Castle, seen here, was almost certainly used as a celestial observatory.

在霍文维普国家纪念碑的台地，峡谷和史前塔楼之间，银河的璀璨光芒尤为生动。 Hovenweep横跨科罗拉多州南部与犹他州的南部边界，距离如此遥远，几乎没有人造光干扰星空的视野。 令人眼花night乱的夜景与建造这些塔楼的祖先普韦布洛人所看到的几乎没有什么不同。 他们是一种农业文化，大约在1100年前首次定居在该地区。 到1200年代后期，他们的人数约为2500人，并在六个不同的村庄建造了这些建筑物和其他建筑物。考古学家提供了几种理论来解释建筑物的用途。 一些防御工事可能是防御工事，储藏区，房屋或这些的任意组合。 但是研究人员建议，在这里看到的名为Hovenweep城堡的塔几乎可以肯定用作天文台。

That's why we're visiting Hovenweep during International Dark Sky Week, which lasts through the weekend. Organizers of the event, held during the week of the new moon in April, encourage us to observe the beauty of the night sky without light pollution. It's easy to do here—in 2014, the International Dark Sky Association named Hovenweep a Dark Sky Park, offering protections that preserve the extraordinarily pristine skies that once shone down on the Ancestral Puebloans.A timeless view of the night sky

这就是为什么我们在整个周末持续的国际黑暗天空周期间访问Hovenweep的原因。该活动的组织者在4月的新月的一周内举行，鼓励我们观察夜空中的美丽，而不会受到光污染。在这里做起来很容易-2014年，国际黑暗天空协会（Honorweep）命名为黑暗天空公园（Hovenweep a Dark Sky Park），提供保护，以保护曾经once然祖先的原始天空。永恒的夜空视野

## ChoreOn the rebirth of the Olympic Games (琐事奥运会的重生)

Today marks the 125th anniversary of the first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens in 1896—1,500 years after they were banned by the Roman emperor. (The original games were held at least as far back as 776 BCE and probably earlier.) The 1896 Games were held in the Panathenaic Stadium, in the shadow of the Acropolis of Athens, shown here. Those newly revived games of 1896 included athletes from 14 countries, with the largest delegations from Greece, Germany, France, and Great Britain. The 43 events included a marathon, tennis, cycling, fencing, shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling, and swimming. And while some things haven't changed over the years, some were pretty different back then. Swimmers were taken out to sea by boat for the longer races and had to swim back to shore. Winners were given a silver medal (copper for second place), as well as an olive branch and a diploma.

今天是1896年在雅典举行的第一届现代奥林匹克运动会成立125周年，距罗马皇帝取缔奥运会已有1500年。 （原始运动会至少可以追溯到公元前776年，甚至更早。）1896年运动会在雅典卫城附近的Panathenaic体育场举行，如图所示。 1896年那些新恢复的运动会包括来自14个国家的运动员，其中最大的代表团来自希腊，德国，法国和英国。 这43项活动包括马拉松，网球，骑自行车，击剑，射击，希腊罗马摔跤和游泳。 尽管有些事情多年来没有改变，但有些事情当时却大不相同。 参加较长时间的比赛时，游泳者被乘船出海，不得不游回岸上。 优胜者获得了银牌（铜牌为第二名），橄榄枝和文凭。

This is a unique time for the Olympics. We can look forward to the postponed 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo (now scheduled to start in July 2021) as well as the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022. The Beijing Games will feature a mascot panda named Bing Dwen Dwen—and we swear we had nothing to do with it. 'Bing' means ice and symbolizes purity and strength, and 'Dwen Dwen' represents children. After the postponement of 2020, we can't wait to hear, 'Let the games begin!'

这是奥运会的独特时期。 我们可以期待在东京推迟的2020年奥运会和残奥会（现在定于2021年7月开始）以及在2022年在北京举行的冬季运动会。北京奥运会将有一只名为Bing Dwen Dwen的吉祥物熊猫，我们发誓 我们与此无关。 “冰”的意思是冰，象征着纯洁和力量，“ Dwen Dwen”代表孩子。 在2020年推迟之后，我们迫不及待想听到“让游戏开始！”
